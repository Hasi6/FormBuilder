## Project Input Validation and Dynamic Validation Settings

This README provides an overview of the input validation capabilities and
dynamic validation settings integrated into the project. These features empower
developers to ensure data integrity and enhance user experience through flexible
validation customization.

### Requirements

- **Node.js 18.x.x:** Ensure you have Node.js 18 installed to take advantage of
  the latest features and performance improvements.

- **npm 9.x.x:** It is recommended to use npm version 9.x.x to manage your
  project's dependencies and packages. This version provides enhanced security
  and reliability.

### Usage and Recommendations

- **Yarn for Package Management:** While npm 9 is recommended, using Yarn as
  your package manager can further optimize dependency resolution and
  installation speed. Yarn has gained popularity for its speed and efficiency in
  managing project dependencies.

### 1. Field Input Validation

Input validation is a fundamental aspect of the project, and it has been
implemented using the Zod library. Zod provides a solid foundation for enforcing
basic field validation, enhancing data quality, and preventing invalid inputs
from compromising the system's integrity.

### 2. Dynamic Validation Setting

One of the standout features of this project is the ability for users to
configure dynamic validations directly through the intuitive UI. This offers a
user-friendly way to define specific validation criteria tailored to the
project's requirements. The dynamic validation process seamlessly integrates
with the Zod library, ensuring consistent and reliable validation.

Key aspects of the dynamic validation setting:

- **User-Friendly Configuration:** Users can effortlessly define and modify
  validation rules through the project's UI. This eliminates the need for manual
  code adjustments and empowers non-technical users to participate in shaping
  data validation.

- **Zod Integration:** The dynamic validation process leverages the power of the
  Zod library. This ensures that even complex validation scenarios are handled
  effectively, maintaining data quality and reliability.

- **Flexible Schema Management:** The project incorporates three initial
  validation schemas, which are defined in the `utils/validationSchema.ts` file.
  These serve as templates for validation rules and can be extended as needed to
  accommodate new requirements. Developers have the flexibility to add
  additional schemas to address evolving validation needs.

- **Error Message Customization:** Developers have the capability to enhance the
  user experience by customizing error messages associated with different
  validation rules. Whenever new validation rules are introduced, updating the
  schema function will enable accurate and informative error messages to be
  displayed to users.

By combining the Zod library with user-friendly dynamic validation settings,
this project ensures that data input is accurate, reliable, and aligned with the
project's specific validation criteria. Developers can easily manage and extend
validation rules, fostering a more efficient and adaptable development process.
